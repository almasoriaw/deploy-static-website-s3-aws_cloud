# Project Setup Guide

This document provides detailed instructions for setting up and deploying the static website to AWS S3 and CloudFront.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this project, ensure you have:

1. An AWS account with appropriate permissions
2. AWS CLI installed and configured (optional, for command-line deployment)
3. The static website files ready for deployment

## Detailed Setup Steps

### 1. S3 Bucket Creation and Configuration

1. **Create an S3 Bucket**:
   - Sign in to the AWS Management Console
   - Navigate to the S3 service
   - Click "Create bucket"
   - Choose a globally unique name (e.g., "my-static-website-123456")
   - Select your preferred region
   - Uncheck "Block all public access" (since this is a public website)
   - Enable versioning if desired
   - Click "Create bucket"

2. **Configure Static Website Hosting**:
   - In your bucket, go to the "Properties" tab
   - Scroll down to "Static website hosting" and click "Edit"
   - Select "Enable"
   - Enter "index.html" for both Index and Error document
   - Click "Save changes"
   - Note the website endpoint URL

3. **Set Bucket Policy**:
   - In your bucket, go to the "Permissions" tab
   - Click "Bucket policy" and then "Edit"
   - Add a policy that allows public read access to your objects:
   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": "*",
         "Action": "s3:GetObject",
         "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/*"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
   - Replace "YOUR-BUCKET-NAME" with your actual bucket name
   - Click "Save changes"

### 2. Upload Website Content

1. **Via AWS Console**:
   - Navigate to your bucket
   - Click "Upload"
   - Add all files and folders from your website
   - Click "Upload"

2. **Via AWS CLI** (alternative method):
   ```bash
   # Upload individual files
   aws s3 cp index.html s3://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/
   
   # Upload directories recursively
   aws s3 cp css/ s3://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/css/ --recursive
   aws s3 cp img/ s3://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/img/ --recursive
   aws s3 cp vendor/ s3://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/vendor/ --recursive
   ```

### 3. CloudFront Distribution Setup

1. **Create a CloudFront Distribution**:
   - Navigate to the CloudFront service in the AWS Console
   - Click "Create Distribution"
   - For Origin Domain, enter your S3 website endpoint URL:
     `YOUR-BUCKET-NAME.s3-website-REGION.amazonaws.com`
   - Origin Protocol Policy: "HTTP Only" (since S3 websites use HTTP)
   - Viewer Protocol Policy: "Redirect HTTP to HTTPS" (recommended)
   - Default Root Object: "index.html"
   - Click "Create Distribution"

2. **Wait for Deployment**:
   - Your distribution will show "In Progress" status
   - Wait until it changes to "Deployed" (can take 5-30 minutes)

### 4. Access Your Website

After everything is set up, your website will be available at:

1. CloudFront URL: `https://xxxxxxxx.cloudfront.net` (xxxxx is the Distribution domain name generated by cloudfront mine was https://d27sdu0tejjoiw.cloudfront.net, your will be different)
2. Access the website via website-endpoint, such as

S3 Website URL: `http://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME.s3-website-REGION.amazonaws.com`
3. Access the bucket object via its S3 object URL, such as:
 https://<bucket-name>.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html.

All three links: CloudFront domain name, S3 object URL, and website-endpoint will show you the same `index.html` content.

Note: If we were not "hosting" the website on S3, we could have made the bucket private and host the content only through the CloudFront domain name. In such a case, we cannot access the private content using S3 object URL and website-endpoint.
